## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to provide a responsive application to allow users to interact with an ever-growing library of board games used for a local meetup group.

Currently stored on Google Sheets - the first phase of development is to provide the same imformation (for example; bgg rating, number of players, duration) in a responsive app.

## Roadmap
- Users should be able to view games currently available
- Users should be able to vote for their choice of game from those available for a monthly meetup event
- Users should be able to create an account and login to protect the voting from manipulation
- Users should be able to add his/her games to the list
- Users should be able to remove his/her games from the list
- Users should be able to add their own rating for each game played (replace BGG ratings)
- to be continued...
